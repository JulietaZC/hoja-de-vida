      <img  src="assets/cat-painting.jpg" alt=" A watercolor painting of a white and brown cat 
       with green eyes. The cat is over a deep brown surface and the background is made of 
       stripes of different shades of green.">
      <p class="catext">
        My cat painting was made by using various watercolor techniques, I painted this cat 
        because it reminded me of one that my aunt used to have. With this project I 
        discovered that I love to paint animals.

        My door painting was made aswell using watercolor for the whole piece. In this project 
        I used different types of perspectives and techniques to achieve a realistic garden.

        This web page started as a school project with two of my best friends. We basically 
        created an imaginary bakery that had everything that would make it perfect for us 
        (music, books, etc). We created a web page for it and although its not completly 
        finished is a nice project to work on with my friends.
