    <p> In here you'll find two of my favorite things in the whole world, music and books. 
    I'll tell you about some of my fav books and what they are about and also my top favorite 
    singers and some of their incredible albums!

      <h2 class="bookstitle"> Books</h2>
      <img src="assets/renegades-image.jpg" alt="A picture of the cover of the book Renegades. 
      The cover shows modern tall buildings in the background and in the center there is a 
      skycraper going all the way up the cover. At both sides of the skycraper there are two 
      characters. On the left side there is a sort of robotic male character showing his 
      profile. His armour is dark blue with red details. On the right side there is a profile 
      of a woman wearing a dark cape with red details aswell and facing downside.">
      <p> The renegades trilogy by Marissa Meyer tells the story of a girl called Nova whose parents and sister 
       were killed by a dangerous gang in their futuristic city. This city is 
       ruled by superheroes called renegades that are supposed to help everyone that needs it, 
       but because they didn't arrive when the girl needed their help, she doesn't believe in 
       them. The actual story starts when she is 18, we see that she joined a villain gang 
       that is opposed to the renegades and their ideas. I love this trilogy because it shows 
      that there is not such thing as completly heroic or evil.</p>

      <img src="assets/harrypotter-image.jpg" alt=" A picture of the cover of the fifth harry 
       potter book. The cover is orange and it shows a big skinny dragon ridden by a black 
       haired boy, Harry Potter. The dragon is flying above a castle that its on the bottom 
       left corner. In the top part of the cover there is the title of the book written with 
       gold foiling and sparkles all around. At the bottom of the book in the center there is 
       a yellow circle with a black lizard representing the name of the publishing house.">
      <p> The Harry Potter series by J.K Rowlling has to be my favorite series I have ever read. It tells the 
       story of a boy, Harry Potter whose parents were killed by Voldemort, a dangerous 
       Wizard, when he was a baby. The truth is that this wizard wasn't trying to kill 
       Harry's parents, he wanted to kill him. Because of this, he is sent to his aunt's house 
       that same night by Dumbledore, the principal of Hogwarts, a magic school. He lives in 
       this house for 11 years where he is treated badly by his uncle, aunt and cousin. 
       One day he receives a letter from Hogwarts telling him that he is a wizard and that he 
       should attend the school. From that day on Harry discovers a new world, filled 
       with people that cares for him. I love this series because it represents how you can 
       find family in people that aren't strictly blood related with you. It also shows the 
       power of love.

      <img src="assets/inhertancegames-image.jpg" alt="A picture of the cover of the second 
      book in the inhertance games trilogy. The cover is dark blue and it has the title in big 
      golden letters. In the background we can see a golden and silver sword across the title 
      and next to it there is a golden crown and a clear bottle with a message inside. On the 
     bottom of the title there is a big golden coin and the name of the author written in 
      white letters.">
      <p> The inhertance games trilogy by Jennifer Lynn Barnes is a YA trilogy tells the story 
     of a young girl called Avery. Her mom passed away and now she is living in her car and 
    has a lot of money problems. One day she gets called from her school, were she finds out 
    that one of the richest families in the country, the Hawthornes, are looking for her 
    because she appears to be the heir of their fortune. The only problem is that for her to 
    receive it she has to live in the mansion for a year with the rest of the family, who are 
    completly confused and angry at her, and are willing to do whatever it takes to get the 
    money. I love this trilogy because its filled with mysteries, riddles and plot twists.

      <h3 class="musictitle"> Music </h3>
      <p id="musictext">My musical taste is full of variety. I love pop, folk, salsa, merengue, rock, slow songs, indie, etc, and I think I owe this to my parents, who are actually kind of music freaks. I would say that my favorite artists would be Taylor Swift first place because I enjoy how lyrical and poetic she can get. Then it would be Morat, a colombian band that mainly sings spanish pop. I love their songs because they've got good rythms and also because their lyrics are really romantic.
